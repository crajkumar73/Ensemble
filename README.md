# Ensemble-Based Classifiers

This topic expands the power of machine learning by aggregating a variety of models. Students learn how to combine a variety of concepts and paradigms into one ensemble learning model.

##### Objectives:

Aggregate multiple learning outcomes into one solution.

Explain how ensemble systems reduce the variance of an automated decision-making system.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Download the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring Data Set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PAMAP2+Physical+Activity+Monitoring.
The PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset contains data of 18 different physical activities (such as walking, cycling, playing soccer, etc.), performed by 9 subjects wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor. The dataset can be used for activity recognition and intensity estimation, while developing and applying algorithms of data processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification.

### Installing
